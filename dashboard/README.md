# Estuary Metrics Dashboard

This is a standalone api module that runs on its own web server.

It uses the estuary authentication api (https://github.com/application-research/estuary-auth) to authenticate request.

Similar to estuary, it needs a Bearer token with an Admin level permission to access the endpoints.

# Access Key
In order to access the API, you need to have an Estuary API key. Please request an API key [here](https://docs.estuary.tech/get-invite-key)

# Build and run
```
yarn install
yarn start
```
